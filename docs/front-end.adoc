== Introduction

The purpose of a front end is to interact with the user. Web applications are
applications that use a web server to present their front end. In our case, we
will build a web application that interacts with the user via a web server, but
uses *Messaging* for any other communication:

----
@startuml

actor "User" as user
node "Front End" as frontend
node "Messaging" as messaging

user <-> frontend : web interface
frontend <-> messaging : messaging library

@enduml
----

To provide the web interface, most applications use some sort of web framework.
The decision of which web framework to use depends largely on the language(s)
the *Front End* developer is comfortable with and what features they would like.
The most common web frameworks for various languages are shown below. You are
encouraged to research them and determine what would best fit your needs.

https://www.python.org/[Python]::
* https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/[Flask]
* https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django]
* https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/[Bottle]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript[JavaScript]::
* https://nodejs.org/en/[Plain NodeJS]
* https://expressjs.com/[Express]
* https://koajs.com/[Koa]
https://www.php.net/[PHP]:: Largely employed as a templating language, PHP is
still popular and can be used in conjunction with a web server as a framework.

To communicate with *Messaging* a library is used. Ultimately this will allow
for a more scalable application. The decision of which library to use is mostly
dependant on what language *Front End* is using. Fortunately RabbitMQ has
https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html[extensive documentation] on using the
most popular messaging libraries for various languages:

Python:: https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html[pika]
JavaScript:: https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-javascript.html[
amqp]
PHP:: https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-php.html[php-amqplib]

A *Front End* developer should be comfortable with HTML for the creation of
views that the user will see and they should be mindful that at some point
their code will need to be run on a production server. There are many options
for production servers depending on what language *Front End* is using:

[horizontal]
Python:: Frameworks use https://www.fullstackpython.com/wsgi-servers.html[WSGI]
for which there are many options.
JavaScript:: Frameworks make use of Node and typically use
https://deploybot.com/blog/guest-post-how-to-set-up-and-deploy-nodejs-express-application-for-production[
managed node processes].
PHP:: Usually served using CGI or a module for a standard web server.

== Example

As an example, we are going to set up a PHP application that presents a web
interface _and_ communicates with *Messaging*. We will be basing our code off of
the https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-php.html[RabbitMQ RPC
tutorial for PHP] and using the https://hub.docker.com/_/php[official PHP Docker
Hub image].

The first problem we have to solve is how to include
https://github.com/php-amqplib/php-amqplib[php-amqplib] with our application. To
do this, we will follow php-amqplib's recommendation and use
https://getcomposer.org/[composer]. No matter what language you are using for
*Front End* it is _very_ important that you learn to use its package management
system. To start, we create a `composer.json` file that lists what version of
PHP we wish to build for, what PHP extensions are needed, and what our
application's requirements are:

.{sourcedir}/web/composer.json
[source, json]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/app/composer.json[]
----

NOTE: The PHP extensions `bcmath` and `sockets` are both required by
`php-emqplib`. We request them in the composer file, but will also install
them in the `Dockerfile`

Now we need to use composer to download and install packages in the `vendor`
directory of our application. Fortunately the official composer Docker image
makes this easy. We can run composer on the image and store the output through
careful use of a bind mount:

[source, console]
----
PS front-end-demo\app> docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/app" composer install <1>

  - Installing php-amqplib/php-amqplib (v2.11.2): Downloading (100%)
phpseclib/phpseclib suggests installing ext-libsodium (SSH2/SFTP can make use of some algorithms provided by the libsodium-php extension.)
phpseclib/phpseclib suggests installing ext-mcrypt (Install the Mcrypt extension in order to speed up a few other cryptographic operations.)
phpseclib/phpseclib suggests installing ext-gmp (Install the GMP (GNU Multiple Precision) extension in order to speed up arbitrary precision integer arithmetic operations.)

----
<1> The `--rm` option removes the container after it finishes. Notice how we
bind link the app directory `front-end-demo/app` (which we are in) with the
`/app` directory on the container. This way all the files that composer creates
are stored locally in our app directory.

We will also need a PHP image with some extra PHP extensions enabled and our
application code in the `/var/www/html` directory. To do this, we use a simple
Dockerfile:

.{sourcedir}/Dockerfile
[source, docker]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/Dockerfile[]
----

Since we are using a container for *Messaging* as well as one for *Front End*,
it would be easiest to use Docker Compose to bring them both up at the same
time. For that, we need to create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

.{sourcedir}/docker-compose.yml
[source, yml]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/docker-compose.yml[]
----

Notice how even though the `Dockerfile` copies the app files to `/var/www/html`
the `docker-compose.yml` still creates a bind mount over top of them. This
allows us to actively develop the PHP code while the container is running. When
we are done developing we can comment out the bind mount and the container will
use the copied files when the image is rebuilt and run.

You may also notice that `docker-compose.yml` uses some environment variables.
It sets them in the container, which we have seen before, _and_ it uses the
`USER` and `PASS` variables from its own environment. These variables are set
in the `.env` file, which Docker Compose reads by default:

.{sourcedir}/.env
[source, shell]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/.env[]
----

Now that our environment is set up. We can develop our PHP application. We start
by augmenting the example `RpcClient` class to use environment variables for
the username and password and `messaging` for the hostname. We will also add an
`send` method that sends JSON data.

TIP: Within the Docker Compose environment, service names will resolve to the IP
addresses of the container within that service. This makes service discovery
_much_ easier.

TIP: Give some thought to what exchange format you want to use. Try to use
something that both *Front End* and *Back End* can support.
https://www.json.org/json-en.html[JSON] is currently the most common choice.

.{sourcedir}/app/rpc_client.php
[source, php]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/app/rpc_client.php[]
----

To test out our `RpcClient` class, let's create a `action.php` endpoint that
takes a POST parameters of `action` and `data` and calls the send procedure with
those parameters:

.{sourcedir}/app/action.php
[source, php]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/app/action.php[]
----

We'll also need a basic form to test it out:

.{sourcedir}/app/action.html
[source, html]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/app/action.html[]
----

WARNING: Try to avoid using GET parameters for these kinds of endpoints. It
makes it too easy for a third party to give a user (presumably authenticated)
an evil link that they can just click on and take an action, ie:
http://localhost:8080/action.php?action=DO+BAD+THINGS.

Now with these components we should be able to run `docker-compose up` in our
`{sourcedir}` directory, watch the services start up, and then open up
http://localhost:8080/action.html to test the functionality:

[source, console]

<1> The front-end service will report the pages being served as you are testing it.
<2> The messaging service will show you the PHP code connecting.
<3> At some point we should make `RpcClient` shut down gracefully.
<4> Because of how logging is handled, you may not see log messages in the order
you expect.

If you test it, this example used the ECHO action and the text "This is a
test", you should see the following output after 10 seconds:
