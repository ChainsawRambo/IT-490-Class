= Back End

image::back-end.png[align=center, width=25%]

== Introduction

*Back End* is responsible for reading messages from *Front End*, storing
things in *Database*, and acquiring any other data needed. It has no
user-facing component, which spares us the trouble of having to run another
web server. Everything can basically be done with a single script.

== Example

For this example we will be implementing a script in JavaScript that reads and
replies to messages via *Messaging*, reads and writes from *Database*, and
performs some demo web scraping. JavaScript is being used because our previous
*Front End* example used PHP. One of the benefits of having a *Messaging*
component is that we can allow developers to use different languages. We will be
basing this code off of the

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.
