= Acknowledgements

The author would like to acknowledge the hard work of DJ Kehoe, whose devotion
to the success of his students led him to create a rigorous, project-based
Systems Integration course. Without his work, none of this would be possible.

This book also would not have been possible without
https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] an open source text processor and
publishing toolchain. Thank you to Dan Allen, Sarah White, Ryan Waldron,
Nick Hengeveld and the Asciidoctor project contributers for making this
publishing tool free and open.

https://plantuml.com[PlantUML] was used for diagram creation and the author
would like to thank Arnaud Roques for creating such a versatile, open source
diagram tool.
