= Project

image::all.png[align=center, width=25%]

This text is meant to accompany the creation of a group project. The project is
designed to be completed by a four person group over a 15 week semester. If you
are using this text as part of a course, all parts of this section are subject
to change / augmentation by your instructor. If you are using this text as an
independent, self-study tool you should still be able to complete all of the
milestones and create the deliverables although it may take you longer. What
follows is the typical assignment schedule for developing the project:

== Project Proposal

The project proposal and the comments on it function as a record of dialog
between the instructor and the group. You can think of the proposal as a
contract showing what is required to achieve a good grade on the project. The
instructor may specify additional deliverables depending on what your group has
chosen to work on, or they may walk-back your proposal if they believe it is
too difficult to achieve in the time frame.

=== Developing a Proposal

Think of a data source that you can use to create a marketable software as a
service (SaaS) product. This data source needs to be freely available for the
purposes of this project. Use the following questions to guide your proposal:

* What data will you use?
* What service will you offer with this data?
* Why would people be willing to pay money for your service?
* Who would be willing to pay money for your service?

Here is an example that you can _not_ use:

.Project Proposal
====
My group will design a web app that allows people in New Jersey to create
itineraries for upcoming events based on what the weather is. We will use data
from https://openweathermaps.org[OpenWeatherMaps.org] as well
https://www.nj.com[NJ.com] to plan separate events based on how filled people
want their schedule and what the weather is going to be like. Our target
demographic is busy professionals who are comfortable using technology. Since
they already use services like Google Calendar for keeping track of their
events, why not try using a service that will suggest upcoming events?
====

== Milestones

The goal of the milestones are to encourage group members to keep pace with the
project. This is not the kind of project that can be completed in the last week
of class. All milestones should be entered in GitHub and linked with Issues
assigned to specific members of the group. Individual contributions of group
members will be assessed through GitHub activity so be sure you are actively
participating.

=== One

* Form a group of four members.
* Each member of the group should read the <<Git>>, <<GitHub>>, <<YAML>>, and
  <<Docker>> chapters.
* Each member of the group should have Docker up and running on their machine.
* Each member of the group should have a GitHub login that utilizes their school
  email.
* As a group, design and submit a <<Project Proposal>>.
* As a group, create a GitHub project with all of the members as collaborators.

=== Two

* Each member of the group should read the <<Messaging>>, <<Database>>,
  <<Front End>>, and <<Back End>> chapters.
* As a group, create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your group repository that
  brings up a messaging service, database service, front end service, and back
  end service.
* *Front End* should at least have at a "Hello World" page available a port
  accessible from the local host.
* *Back End* should be able to read from and write to a queue on *Messaging*.
* The completion of this milestone should be documented through the use of
  Issues in your GitHub project.

=== Three

* *Back End* should be able to read and write from *Database*.
* *Front End* should have a register new user page and a login page. They do not
  have to be functional, but the HTML development should be done.
* *Database* should at least have a `user` table on a persistent volume that can
  be accessed by *Back End*.
* Documentation should be developed that describes how to use the RabbitMQ
  management interface to check to see if queues are being created. The
  documentation should take the form of a README file in any GitHub supported
  format within the messaging directory.
* The completion of this milestone should be documented through the use of
  Issues in your GitHub project.

=== Four

* Each member of the group should read the <<Replication>> and <<Kubernetes>>
  chapters.
* Each member of the group needs to have minikube up and running on their
  machine.
* *Database* needs to move from a single instance to a replicated, high
  availability, load balancing cluster. For now, the instances can be statically
  configured inside a `docker-compose.yml` file.
* The completion of this milestone should be documented through the use of
  Issues in your GitHub project.

=== Five

* Each member of the group should read the <<Database in Kubernetes>> and
  <<Messaging in Kubernetes>> chapters.
* Migrate *Database* to Kubernetes using the minikube environment. Put all of
  your Kubernetes objects in one file named <component>-k8s.yml in your
  repository (where <component> is your component name.
* Migrate *Messaging* to Kubernetes using the minikube environment. Put all of
  your Kubernetes objects in one file named <component>-k8s.yml in your
  repository (where <component> is your component name.
* The completion of this milestone should be documented through the use of
  Issues in your GitHub project.

=== Six

* Each member of the group should read the <<Front End in Kubernetes>> and
  <<Back End in Kubernetes>> chapters.
* Migrate *Front End* to Kubernetes using the minikube environment. Put all of
  your Kubernetes objects in one file named <component>-k8s.yml in your
  repository (where <component> is your component name.
* Migrate *Back End* to Kubernetes using the minikube environment. Put all of
  your Kubernetes objects in one file named <component>-k8s.yml in your
  repository (where <component> is your component name.
* The completion of this milestone should be documented through the use of
  Issues in your GitHub project.

== Deliverables

Deliverables are larger assessments designed to show a running system. Given
deployment-centric nature of the project, it should be easy to bring up the
deliverables on any system to test them. Groups are encouraged to test running
their system on new a different machines to make sure that everything will go
well when it is time to assess their project. Groups are also encouraged and
_expected_ to keep the deliverables in mind over the course of the entire
project.

=== Midterm

* *Front End* (Python, PHP, or Node) interacts with the user via HTTP and
  communicates with *Messaging* via a messaging library.
* *Messaging* (RabbitMQ) brokers the exchange of information between *Front End*
  and *Back End*.
* *Database* (PostgreSQL, MariaDB, or MySQL) is used by *Back End* uses for the
  storage of persistent information. All database files are stored in a Docker
  volume.
* *Back End* container that gathers information from your data sources, stores
  information on *Database*, and interacts with *Messaging*.
* These four services will be working with each other to provide a registration
  and authentication system for your users.
* The project should be fully testable on any machine running Docker by simply
  cloning the git repository and running `docker up` in the root of the project.

=== Final Deliverables

* *Front End*, *Database*, *Messaging*, and *Back End* should all be running in
  pods on the minikube Kubernetes Cluster. Each should have three replicas.
* *Front End*, *Database*, *Messaging*, and *Back End* should all be able to
  scale horizontally and recover from the failure of pods.
* The project should be fully testable on any machine running minikube by simply
  cloning the git repository and running, building the custom images locally
  (with an environment configured for the Docker daemon running _within_
  minikube), and running `kubectl apply -f .` in the root of the project.
