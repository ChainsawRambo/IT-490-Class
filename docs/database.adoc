== Introduction

Databases are used to store and organize information in a manner consistent
with the relationships in that data. This allows for more natural queries to
retrieve information. For example, if you typically look up a car part by its
ID, it would make sense to have a table of part IDs with names and
descriptions. A car can be thought of as a collection of parts, therefore you
could have a car table and a car_part table that relates a car ID to multiple
part IDs:

.Tables in a Relational Database
[plantuml, tables, svg]
....
@startuml

skinparam linetype ortho

entity car {
  *car_id: INTEGER
  --
  *make: VARCHAR(64)
  *model: VARCHAR(256)
  *year: DECIMAL(4, 0)
}

entity car_part {
  *car_id: INTEGER
  *part_id: INTEGER
}

entity part {
  *part_id: INTEGER
  --
  *name: VARCHAR(256)
  description: VARCHAR(1024)
  manufacturers_partnum: VARCHAR(256)
  price: DECIMAL(10, 2)
}

car ||--|{ car_part
car_part ||--|| part

Relational databases maintain the integrity of their relations at the cost of
being rigid and requiring more setup. In our system we will employ a relational
database for multiple reasons:

* Relational databases are the most popular databases in use today.
* SQL is the most marketable computer language in the world and with the growth
  of data science, this is not changing any time soon.
* Relational databases present unique challenges with regard to replication.
  This will provide a good learning opportunity later in the text.

A database will be used for the _persistent_ storage of information. In a
container environment, it is very important to make the distinction between
_ephemeral_ and _persistent_ storage. A container may have lots of information
on its filesystem but if that container is stopped, that information is lost.
All _stateful_ information, that is information that needs to survive the
container lifecycle, should be stored on a database which utilizes an external
volume.

.Containerized Database using a Volume
[plantuml, volumes, svg]
....
@startuml

storage volume as "Volume" {
    file dbfiles as "Database Files"
}
node container as "Container" {
    database RDBMS
}

RDBMS <-> dbfiles

@enduml
....

As can be seen above, the volume exists _outside_ of the container running the
relational database management system (RDBMS). The volume holds the database
files the RDBMS uses to store information and if the container is stopped or
removed, the files remain.

== Popular RDMS

For our project we can use any one of the following RDMS:

https://www.mysql.com/[MySQL]::
MySQL is an RDMS that has grown out of the practical need for a relational
database in Linux. It quite literally puts the 'M' in the venerable LAMP stack
(Linux Apache MySQL PHP). It has native support for replication and many other
practical features that make it an excellent choice for any project.
https://mariadb.org/[MariaDB]::
MariaDB is a RDMS that aims to be be feature and syntax compliant with MySQL.
It was originally forked from MySQL and developed as a response to Oracle's
purchase of Sun Microsystems, who bought MySQL. It as actively developed and
widely popular.
https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL]::
PostgreSQL is an _object_ relational database management system that aims to
be more SQL compliant than MySQL. Where MySQL was borne out of workplace need,
PostgreSQL has an academic lineage. It is enterprise ready, massively scalable
(although it relies on several other tools for replication), and has fewer
licensing issues than MySQL. PostgreSQL is seeing growing adoption.

== Example

In this example we will start a MySQL container, initialize it with the
SQL file shown below, and connect to it with the
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html[mysql client]. The
`setup.sql` file that initializes our database can be found in the
`{sourcedir}` directory. It sets up a simple car part database for our example:

.{sourcedir}/setup.sql
[source, sql]
----
include::{sourceroot}/{sourcedir}/setup.sql[]
----

Be sure to check to https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql[documentation for the Docker
image you are using] to see how to initialize a database and to learn about
which environment variables you will need to use. In this case,
we will bind mount the current directory to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` on
the container so our `setup.sql` file is run the first time the container is
started. We will also use environment variables to set up a database, username,
and password.

Now let's create a volume, and run our container:

[source, console]
----
PS db-demo> docker volume create db-data <1>
db-data
PS db-demo> docker volume ls <2>
DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
local               db-data
PS db-demo> docker run -d --mount "type=volume,src=db-data,dst=/var/lib/mysql" --mount "type=bind,src=$(pwd),dst=/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d" -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=changeme -e MYSQL_DATABASE=cars -e MYSQL_USER=car_user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=changeme mysql:8.0.20 <3>

<1> We create a volume named `db-data`
<2> and now we can see it listed in the available volumes.
<3> This lengthy command translates to:
* `run`: mysql version 8.0.20
* `-d`: in the background
* `--mount "type=volume,src=db-data,dst=/var/lib/mysql"`: mount the volume named
  db-data to /var/lib/mysql on the container
* `--mount "type=bind,src=$(pwd),dst=/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d"`: mount the
  current directory, we have to use pwd here because it wants an absolute path,
  to /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d on the container. This is a bind mount which
  is a quick linkage between a directory on the host and a directory on the
  container. Bind mounts may not support all of the features you need, but for
  our purposes it works well here. Our current directory has the `setup.sql`
  file that we use to initialize our database.
* `-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=changeme`: use an environment variable to set the root
  password for mysql access
* `-e MYSQL_DATABASE=cars`: use an environment variable to set the database we
  initialize
* `-e MYSQL_USER=car_user`: use an environment variable to create a new user
  that can access the database we set up
* `-e MYSQL_PASSWORD=changeme`: use an environment variable to set a password
  for the user we created above
<4> Check to see that our container is running and get the ID
<5> Examine the log output for our container (by ID)
<6> We can see here in the output, that our `setup.sql` script was run

With our container running in the background, we can now connect and make sure
that our database was initialized. To avoid having to download a mysql client
on the host, we will `exec` the mysql command on the running container:

[source, console]

TIP: `docker volume prune` is a useful command for getting rid of volumes not
in use by any container. Just be sure that you don't need the data on those
volumes anymore!
