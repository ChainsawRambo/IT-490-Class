== Version Control

In the simplest sense, version control tracks changes to a group of files.
Building off of this premise, teams can use version control to cooperative
change a group of files and revert to a previous state if needed.

Some of the benefits of a version control system can be understood if you
consider a few examples:

.Programming Project
====
You are working on a project for your CS101 class and you need to write a
Python program that plays tic-tac-toe. It must support player-vs-computer
_and_ player-vs-player. It's due in two days. On the first day you write the
initial code and implement player-vs-player. It works great and you fall asleep
knowing tomorrow you will finish it and turn it in on time. The next morning
you update it to support player-vs-computer and _everything_ stops working.
What do you do now? 
====

If you were working with a version control system, you could easily roll-back
your changes and see what went wrong.

.Working with a Team
====
You are working working with a team of people to implement a complex system
that utilizes several files in several different directories. How do you make
sure everyone has the most up-to-date version of the files? What happens if two
people work on the same file at the same time?
====

In a version control system, you could set up a centralized repository for the
files and have everyone pull from one location. In the case of two people
working on the same thing at the same time, a version control system could
handle merging their changes.

== Getting Git

Depending on the OS you are using, there are a few different ways to install
git on your machine:

Windows::
* https://gitforwindows.org/[git for windows]: Installs git, git BASH, and a
GUI. The git command can then be run from PowerShell, CMD, or the BASH shell
(which it installs).
Mac::
* https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/[git for Mac Installer]:
  Provides an easy installer for git on MacOS. 
* https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Xcode]: Xcode installs a command line git
  and you may have it installed already. 
Linux::
* Basically all distributions have git available in their standard package
  manager. Chances are, if you're running Linux you have it installed already,
  so I'll take the opportunity to highlight the strangest distro I can think of:
  You can install git in http://hannahmontana.sourceforge.net/[Hannah Montana
  Linux] with the command `apt-get install git`.

== Basic Git Actions

=== Creating a Repository

Any directory can be made into a git repository by running the `git init`
command. This will add the `.git` directory which stores information about the
state of the repository and certain user variables.

=== Cloning a Repository

If you want to make a copy of an already existing repository, typically done
when you _start_ working on a project, the `git clone` command will make a copy
of a repository using any supported protocol.

=== Tracking / Staging Files

You need to tell git which files you want to keep track of and when you want to
stage them to be committed. These both use the same command `git add`. The
first time you call `git add` it begins tracking the file and stages it for a
commit. The second time you call `git add` it tells git that you want to commit
any changes to that file.

=== Committing Changes to a Repository

Once you have made some changes to your repository and staged those files with
`git add` you can use the `git commit` command to _commit_ your changes. All
commits must have a message, and git will use a default editor depending on
your installation.
https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/associating-text-editors-with-git[
This can be changed.] To complete the commit, add a message, save the file, and
exit the editor.

=== Setting Up a Remote

Git repositories are often linked to a remote repository. This could be a
service, like https://github.com[GitHub], https://gitlab.com[GitLab], or
https://sr.ht[SourceHut] or more simply another server that the team has
access to. The `git remote add origin` command adds a remote URL that is the
default target for actions. You can then `git push` your changes to the remote
or `git pull` to get the latest changes from the remote. The `git clone`
command automatically sets the origin.

== Example

Let's take a look at an example of two people, Jessica and Darsh, working with
the same remote repository:

----
<1> Jessica will be creating the repository, so she makes a new directory
<2> Inside the directory, she uses `git init` to initialize it
<3> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/set-content?view=powershell-7[
She adds some content so she has something to commit]
<4> The form `git add .` means _stage all files in this directory_. It is the
most common invokation of `git add`.
<5> Jessica commits her work. The `-m` option allows her to add a commit
message without needing to open an editor.
<6> She adds a remote as the default. This _does_ require configuration on the
remote server, a local machine in our case, but we will talk about how that is
usually handled in the <<GitHub>> section.
<7> Finally she pushes her changes to the remote so that Darsh can get them.

----
<1> Darsh isn't creating a new repository so he uses the `git clone` command to
clone the repository Jessica has made.
<2> By default, cloned repositories are put in their own directory based on the
repository name. You can specify a different directory by adding an argument
after the URL: `git clone ssh://git@192.168.10.1:/home/git/example.git
new-directory`
<3> Jess's content is there!
<4> Darsh appends a message of his own.
<5> Then he follows the standard add, commit, push work flow to sync his
changes.

.Jessica's Second Session (PowerShell)
[source, shell]
----
PS jess\example> Get-Content -Path 'test.txt'
Hello from git! <1>
PS jess\example> git pull origin master <2>
git@192.168.10.1's password:
From ssh://192.168.10.1/home/git/example
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD

Fast-forward
 test.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
PS jess\example> Get-Content -Path 'test.txt'
Hello from git! <3>
Hello Jess!
----
<1> When Jess goes to check on Darsh's work, it isn't there! Why?
<2> Because she hasn't pulled from the remote yet.
<3> Once she does, she can see Darsh's addition

This scenario begs the question, "What would happen if Jess didn't pull Darsh's
work and kept working on her local, unsynced copy?" Assuming they were both
working on the same file, when Jess goes to push there would be a
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts[merge
conflict.] Git is very good at resolving conflicts and team members tend to be
working on different parts of the codebase, making the resolution simpler.
